Recently, I encountered an interesting challenge with a batch of Gigaset SL750 phones that were mistakenly being recognized as Unify Openscape SL5's. My task was to reprogram these phones to work with a Gigaset DECT system. This journey took me deep into the realm of reverse engineering and protocol understanding. Here's a detailed look at how I approached this task.

## Reversing the Protocol

My first step was to understand how the Gigaset "QuickSync" tool communicates with the phone. Using Device Monitoring Studio, I intercepted the communication between QuickSync and the phone, which revealed that the phone utilizes AT commands for data transmission. Despite a deep dive into the .NET DLLs of QuickSync, my limited experience in reversing .NET applications made it challenging to find the right file. That's when I discovered the FWUUI, Gigaset's internal utility for firmware updates. With some AI assistance, I was able to extract the functions and compile a comprehensive list of AT commands into a PDF.

## Writing the Updater

Through this investigation, I learned that the `AT^SRSR` command is crucial for initiating the update process. The device responds with specific requests for firmware blocks, which I then supply. Here's a snippet of the code that initiates this sequence:

```python
def initiate_update_sequence(ser):
    ser.write(b'AT^SRSR 2\r\n')
    print("Sent AT^SRSR 2 to the device")
    ...
```

And here's how the device typically responds, requiring an 'OK' to proceed:

```
^SRSR: 1

OK
```

The process involves sending the requested data blocks to the device. The device indicates its needs using the `AT^SGBD` command, specifying the offset and size. Here's a part of the code that handles this:

```python
def send_data(ser, file, offset, size):
    ...
    ser.write(data + b'OK\r\n')
    print(f"Sent data from offset {offset} with size {size}")
```

During the update, logs resemble this:

```
AT^SGBD 0x0000C05A, 0x000003FB
```

This log snippet indicates the device's request for a specific block of data, which is then sent by the updater tool. 

Integrating these snippets directly into your workflow offers a clear window into the technical aspects of this task, showcasing the intricate dance between issuing commands and responding to the device's specific needs. This approach not only rectifies the misidentification of the phones but also illuminates the path for similar future endeavors.
